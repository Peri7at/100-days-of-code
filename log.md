# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 20, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Back End Development and APIs on FreeCodeCamp. Specifically 'Managing Packages with NPM' and 'Basic Node and Express' topics.

**Thoughts** I've recently graduated from Back End Development Bootcamp, and right now I am just trying to develop myself more in Back End Development. All of the exercises are basics, completed them just to go in the order of the freeCodeCamp's curriculum and for the sake of completion of all the exercises before starting to do the projects.

### Day 1: March 21, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through first three exercises on 'MongoDB and Mongoose' topic. Though I had used MongoDB and Mongoose throughout bootcamp, created MongoDB Atlas Cluster for the first time and used it in the exercises.

**Thoughts** The exercises are basics, completed them just to go in the order of the freeCodeCamp's curriculum and for the sake of completion of all the exercises before starting to do the projects.

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 'MongoDB and Mongoose' topic and exercises.

**Thoughts** The exercises are basics, completed them just to go in the order of the freeCodeCamp's curriculum and for the sake of completion of all the exercises before starting to do the projects. Excited to start building some projects from tomorrow.

### Day 3: March 23, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through first 17 exercises of Object Oriented Programming on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** The exercises are basics, completed them just to go in the order of the freeCodeCamp's curriculum and for the sake of completion of all the exercises before starting to do the projects. I did not start building any project yet. Planning to complete all previous exercises and projects before Back End Development on freeCodeCamp. Sometimes is nice to refresh the stuff you already know.
